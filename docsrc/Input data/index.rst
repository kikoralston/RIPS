Input data
**********

The simulation uses data from different sources. It expects the data to be
inside a directory with a specific subfolder structure. The path for this
directory must be specified in the field `dataRoot` of the
:ref:`general-param` object.

Because of their potential large size, climate and hydrological data can be stored in a separate
folder. This diredtory must be specified in the Curtailment Parameters object.
