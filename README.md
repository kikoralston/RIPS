## Capacity expansion / unit commitment and economic dispatch under climate change

The capacity expansion / unit commitment and economic dispatch under climate change model uses an integrated,
multi-model framework to examine how climate-related risks in the power sector could affect power system's planning and
operation decisions.

A more detailed documentation of the CE/UCED model is available at:
